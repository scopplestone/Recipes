1. Step

    Use mortar and pestle to crush and grind the dried Allspice and Juniper berries.

1. Step

    Very finely dice the onion, red peppers and garlic and set aside in three different containers.

1. Step

    Cut the meat into large chunks.
    Heat clarified butter in a large cauldron or cast-iron stew pot and fry the meat for 2-5 minutes.
    Add the finely diced onions and continue frying.
    When enough water has been evaporated, add the finely diced bell pepper.
    Continue cooking on high heat until the meat, onions and bell pepper are browned.
    Add the flour and continue cooking until brown.
    Use red wine during this process for deglazing of the pot.

1. Step

    Add the minced garlic and cook for 2 minutes until the flavour is released. Then add the spices and bay leaf.

1. Step

    Add the tomato paste and lightly brown the mixture before filling up with beef stock. Add more water if required.

1. Step

    Slowly cook with the lid on leaving only a small gap for vapour to escape and simmer for at least 90 minutes until the meat is
    tender. If you use a pressure cooker, this step will only require 30 minutes. But be careful to add enough water to create a
    thin mixture to reduce the effect of burning the pot.
