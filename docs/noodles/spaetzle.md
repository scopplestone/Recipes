1. Step

    The ratio of flour to eggs has been measured to yield the targeted dough consistency.
    Crack 10 eggs into a bowl, measure their weight and weigh the required amount of flour.
    If you are already experienced, just keep adding flour until the correct consistency is achieved.

1. Step

    Mix the eggs and salt by stirring them thoroughly using a whisk.
    Start adding the flour in batches until it thickens and stir using a wooden spoon.
    Keep stirring until bubbles start appearing and let the dough rest for 5 minutes before continuing.
    The dough must not be too runny as this would result in thin Spätzle and not too thick so that it goes through the Spätzle press easily.
    It needs to be sticky, thick, slightly tough and have a consistency that very slowly runs down the back of a spoon (thicker than honey).

1. Step

    Bring 2-3 litres of water in a large pot to a boil.
    Use the largest pot available and leave 4 cm space to the top of the pot.
    This will prevent water from overflowing when the Spätzle are placed in the simmering water.

1. Step

    When the water is boiling, fill the Spätzle press with dough and place over the pot and sqeeze into the water.
    Remove the pot from the heat and stir the Spätzle slowly for them to cook evenly and prevent lumping, which takes abount 30 seconds.
    Place the hot Spätzle in the cold water to quench them.
    Remove quickly from the cold water and place in a bowl with a drainage or place them in a sieve to remove excess water before placing them in a bowl.

1. Step

    Bring the hot water to a boil and repeat the previous step until the dough is completely used up.
    The hot water is consumed over time, so add a little water from time to time.
