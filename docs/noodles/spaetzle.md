1. Step

    The ratio of flour to eggs has been measured to yield the targeted dough consistency.
    Crack 10 eggs into a bowl, measure their weight and weigh the required amount of flour with the ratio in the table above.
    If you are already experienced, just keep adding flour in the next step until the correct consistency is achieved.

1. Step

    Mix the eggs and salt by stirring them thoroughly using a whisk.
    Start adding the flour in batches until the dough thickens and keep stirring constantly using a wooden spoon.
    When all flour is mixed into the dough, keep stirring until bubbles start appearing and let the dough rest for 5 minutes before continuing.
    The dough must not be too runny as this would result in thin Spätzle and not too thick so that it passes through the Spätzle press without too much pressure.
    It needs to be sticky, thick, slightly tough and have a consistency (thicker than honey) making the dough run very slowly down the back of a spoon.
    The correct consistency comes with experience and will improve over time.

1. Step

    Bring 2-3 litres of water in a large pot to a boil.
    Use the largest pot available and leave 4 cm space to the top of the pot.
    This will prevent water from overflowing when the Spätzle are placed in the simmering water.

1. Step

    When the water is boiling, fill the Spätzle press with dough and place over the pot and sqeeze into the water.
    Remove the pot from the heat and stir the Spätzle slowly for them to cook evenly and prevent lumping, which takes abount 30 to 60 seconds.
    Place the hot Spätzle in the cold water to quench them.
    Remove quickly from the cold water and place in a bowl with a drainage or place them in a sieve to remove excess water before placing them in a bowl.

1. Step

    Bring the hot water to a boil again and repeat the previous step until the dough is used up.
    The hot water is consumed over time, so add a little water from time to time.
    Similarly, the cold water is heated up over time, so replace it with fresh cold water when it becomes too warm.
