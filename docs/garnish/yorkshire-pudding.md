1. Step

    Heat the oven to 190 degrees Celsius

1. Step

    Heat 1cm of oil in each mould for at least 15 minutes until the oil is very hot and starts to smoke

1. Step

    Make the batter in a bowl and transfer to a measuring jug for easier pouring into the muffin tray.

1. Step

    Pour the batter into the muffin tray and use a spoon to capture dripping batter (otherwise this might prevent the Yorkshire
    puddings from correctly rising during the baking process). The more batter that is used for each muffin tray mould, the larger
    the pudding will be.

1. Step

    Bake for 20-25 minutes and do not open the oven during that time. Check if the Yorkshire puddings are crispy before removing the
    muffin tray from the oven. Have them rather crispy instead of too soft.
