1. Step

    Cook potatoes in pressure cooker for 8 minutes (2nd ring) and let the pot cool of on stove so that the temperature and pressure reduce slowly.

1. Step

    Finely chop the onions and set aside.

1. Step

    Remove potatoes from cooker and set aside to cool of for 5-10 minutes until they can be pealed with ease.

1. Step

    Cool pealed potatoes for 5 more minutes until they are hard enough to be cut without being squashed. Also they absorb too much
    liquid when water/vinegar is added if they are too hot.

1. Step

    Mix vinegar and water 5:1 and use 50% of the total amount at the beginning (add more if needed, i.e., if the potatoes absorb the liquid instantly).
    The amount depends on how old the potatoes are and what their type is.
    Never add the vinegar/water mix after the oil has been added as this creates a slimy consistency, which must be prevented.

1. Step

    Add onions to bowl and use an egg separator or potato cutter to cut the potatoes into fine slices. Hold the cutter horizontally
    in order for the slices to separate when falling into the bowl.

1. Step

    Before adding the vinegar/water mixture make sure that the potatoes in the bowl have cooled down and are not hot.
    Then add 50% of the amount and let the potatoes absorb the liquid for a few minutes before adding the oil in the next step.

1. Step

    Add 3-4 Tbsp. of vegetable oil and thoroughly mix the ingredients.
    Sprinkle with a little Dill when ready to serve.
