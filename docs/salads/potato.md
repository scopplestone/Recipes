    Finely chop the onions and set aside.

1. Step

    Remove potatoes from cooker and set aside to cool of for 10 minutes until they can be pealed easily.

1. Step

    Cool pealed potatoes for 10 more minutes until they are hard enough to be cut without being squashed. Also they absorb too much
    liquid when water/vinegar is added if they are too hot.

1. Step

    Mix vinegar and water 5:1 and use only 50% and add more if needed. The amount depends on how old the potatoes are and their type.

1. Step

    Add onions to bowl and use an egg separator or potato cutter to cut the potatoes into fine slices. Hold the cutter horizontally
    in order for the slices to separate easily when falling into the bowl.

1. Step

    Before adding the vinegar/water mixture make sure that the potatoes in the bowl have cooled down. Then add 50% and let the
    potatoes absorb the liquid for 5 minutes.

1. Step

    Add 3 Tbsp. of vegetable oil and thoroughly mix the ingredients. Sprinkle with a little Dill when ready to serve.
