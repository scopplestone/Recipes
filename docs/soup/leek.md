1. Step

    Clean the leeks under water to remove all remaining dirt and cut into rings of approx. 5 mm thickness.

    Heat some oil in a heavy casserole and add minced beef when the oil is hot.
    Stir fry meat until browned thoroughly.
    Remove and set aside.

    Heat more oil in the casserole and add the leek.
    Clover with a lid and stir every few minutes to prevent burning until enough water is released from the leek.

    Coarsely cut the potato and finely chop the onion and garlic, add everting to the leek and stir fry without the lid.
    Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and nutmeg.
    Fill up with beef stock and simmer with lid on for at least 15 minutes.

    Use immersion blender to smoothly purée the soup and add water if it thickens too much. Cut the Camembert into small pieces and
